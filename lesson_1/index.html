<p>
    The series is a satirical depiction of American life, epitomized by the Simpson family, which consists of Homer,
    Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. The show is set in the fictional town of Springfield and parodies American culture
    and society, television, and the human condition.

<!--  Homer-->

<h2><a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Homer_Simpson">Homer Simpson</a></h2>
<img src="images/img.png" alt="">
<p>Homer Jay Simpson (born May 12, 1956)[40] is a man from Springfield. He is the spouse of Marge Simpson and father of
    Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson. Homer is overweight (said to be 239 pounds)[41], lazy, and often ignorant to the
    world around him. Although he has many flaws, he has shown to have great caring, love, and even bravery to those he
    cares about and, sometimes, even others he doesn't. His favorite color is blue, and he enjoys dancing, eating
    donuts, drinking, hugging, driving a sit-down arcade racer, playing the piano and horse riding. His favorite kiddie
    rides are "Stuart Little", "Barney Train" and "Ride the Champion Mechanical Horse". Homer works as a low-level
    safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant in Sector 7G, although he is often incompetent and negligent
    towards his duties. He spends a great deal of his time at Moe's Tavern with his friends Barney Gumble, Carl Carlson,
    Lenny Leonard, and Moe Szyslak. At home, he can often be found sitting on the couch mindlessly watching TV while
    snacking on food and drinking Duff. Homer is also the only son of Abraham Simpson II and Mona Simpson. When
    provoked, he often strangles Bart for pressuring him. Even though he mutually hates his wife's sisters Patty and
    Selma Bouvier, he played Selma's husband for her to adopt Ling and agreed to be the minister for Patty's intended
    homosexual marriage. As a result of this, Homer is her legal adoptive father.[42] Homer may just be a normal man,
    but he has had many great achievements and experiences in his life. He has won a Grammy, an Academy Award, a
    Pulitzer Prize, been to space and saved Springfield many times. Contents 1 Biography 1.1 Childhood Summary 1.2 Jobs

<h2><a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Bart_Simpson">Bart Simpson</a></h2>
<img src="images/Bart_Simpson.webp" alt="">
<p>Bartholomew JoJo "Bart" Simpson (born Feburary 23 or April 1, 1980)[7]is the mischievous, rebellious, misunderstood,
    disruptive and "potentially dangerous" oldest child of the Simpson family in The Simpsons. He is the only son of
    Homer and Marge Simpson, and the older brother of Lisa and Maggie. He also has been nicknamed "Cosmo", after
    discovering a comet in "Bart's Comet". Bart has also been on the cover on numerous comics, such as "Critical Hit",
    "Simpsons Treasure Trove #11", and "Winter Wingding". Bart also has a 100-issue comic series entitled the Simpson
    Comics Presents Bart Simpson. Bart is loosely based on Matt Groening and his older brother, Mark Groening.

    Even at a young age, Bart has accomplished many feats. He has won an award for his Angry Dad web series[8], he has
    discovered a new comet which was named after him[9], and he also has performed in a successful band with Milhouse
    Van Houten, Nelson Muntz, and Ralph Wiggum.[10</p>

<!--Liza-->

<h2><a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Lisa_Simpson">Lisa Simpson</a></h2>
<img src="images/liza.png" alt="">
<p>In "Homer and Lisa Exchange Cross Words" she is also known as Lisa Bouvier. She was named after a train called Lil'
    Lisa on her parents' 1st anniversary. She is a charismatic 8-year-old girl, who exceeds the standard achievement of
    the intelligence level of children her age. Not to everyone's surprise, she is also the moral center of her family.
    In her upbringing, Lisa lacks parental involvement of Homer and Marge, which leads to hobbies such as playing
    saxophone and guitar, riding and caring for horses, and interest in advanced studies. In school, Lisa's popularity
    is affected by those who view her as a geeky overachiever, which leaves her with only a few friends. She focuses on
    her goals and strives to reach her potential, and at the age of eight, she is already a member of Mensa with an IQ
    of 159. Her lack of parental involvement also leads to her lashing out at those who she deems lower than her or even
    above her. She has extreme jealousy from time to time and will do whatever it takes to reclaim her title as the
    smartest; but only if she deems it necessary. Otherwise, she's the intelligent one who usually thinks things
    through.</p>
